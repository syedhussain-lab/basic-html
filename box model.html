   <p> Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a
    group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence
    of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</p>
